# ðŸŽ¤ Voice-Based Conflict Resolution Fixes

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Missing Meeting Details in Conflict Resolution**

**Problem**: Original meeting details were lost during conflict resolution, causing "Missing meeting details" errors.

**Solution**:

- Modified `handle_conflict_resolution()` in `conversation_flow.py` to preserve original meeting data
- Updated `handle_conflict_resolution_response()` in `main.py` to use preserved meeting data
- Added proper session cleanup for `original_meeting_data`

```python
# In conversation_flow.py
if 'original_meeting_data' in conflict_data:
    session['original_meeting_data'] = conflict_data['original_meeting_data']

# In main.py
original_meeting_data = session.get('original_meeting_data')
if not original_meeting_data:
    # Fallback to partial meeting details
```

### 2. **Multiple Audio Commands Playing Simultaneously**

**Problem**: Multiple audio responses were playing at the same time, causing confusion.

**Solution**:

- Added `isPlayingAudio` state to track audio playback
- Modified `playAudioFromHex()` to prevent simultaneous audio playback
- Added proper cleanup when audio ends

```typescript
const [isPlayingAudio, setIsPlayingAudio] = useState(false);

const playAudioFromHex = async (hexAudio: string): Promise<void> => {
  if (isPlayingAudio) {
    console.log("ðŸ”‡ Audio already playing, skipping...");
    return;
  }
  setIsPlayingAudio(true);
  // ... audio playback logic
  source.onended = () => {
    tempAudioContext.close();
    setIsPlayingAudio(false);
  };
};
```

### 3. **UI-Based Selection Removed**

**Problem**: User wanted pure voice-based selection, not UI buttons.

**Solution**:

- Removed all interactive UI elements (buttons, click handlers)
- Made conflict resolution panel purely informational
- Added clear voice command instructions
- Added visual indicator showing system is waiting for voice input

```jsx
{
  /* Voice-only conflict resolution panel */
}
<div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-4">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
    <Mic className="w-4 h-4 text-blue-600" />
    <p className="text-sm font-medium text-blue-800">Voice Commands:</p>
  </div>
  <div className="text-sm text-blue-700 space-y-1">
    <p>
      â€¢ Say <strong>"Option 1"</strong>, <strong>"Option 2"</strong>, or{" "}
      <strong>"Option 3"</strong> to select
    </p>
    <p>
      â€¢ Say <strong>"Different times"</strong> to get new options
    </p>
    <p>
      â€¢ Say <strong>"Cancel"</strong> to cancel scheduling
    </p>
  </div>
</div>;
```

### 4. **Configuration Message Handling**

**Problem**: Backend wasn't handling configuration messages from frontend.

**Solution**:

- Added support for `config` message type in WebSocket handler
- Added confirmation response to frontend
- Added proper timezone and voice preference handling

```python
if message_type == "config":
    logger.info(f"Received configuration: timezone={data.get('timezone')}, voice={data.get('voice')}")
    session['timezone'] = data.get('timezone', 'UTC')
    session['voice'] = data.get('voice', 'en-IN-NeerjaNeural')
    await websocket.send_text(json.dumps({
        "type": "config_received",
        "message": f"Configuration updated: {session['timezone']}, {session['voice']}",
        "session_id": session_id
    }))
```

## Voice Command Processing Flow

### 1. **Normal Scheduling**

```
User: "Schedule meeting tomorrow at 2 PM"
â†“ Speech-to-Text
â†“ GPT Processing
â†“ Calendar Service
â†“ Success/Conflict Detection
```

### 2. **Conflict Resolution Flow**

```
User: "Schedule meeting tomorrow at 2 PM"
â†“ Speech-to-Text: "schedule meeting tomorrow at 2 PM"
â†“ GPT Processing: intent="schedule_meeting", entities={...}
â†“ Calendar Service: Detects conflict
â†“ Backend: Sets awaiting_conflict_resolution=True
â†“ Frontend: Shows conflict panel (voice-only)
â†“ User: "Option 2" (voice command)
â†“ Speech-to-Text: "option 2"
â†“ Backend: process_conflict_selection() â†’ returns 2
â†“ Calendar Service: schedule_suggested_slot(original_data, 2)
â†“ Success: Meeting scheduled with selected option
```

## Voice Command Recognition

The system recognizes these patterns for conflict resolution:

### Option Selection:

- "option 1", "option 2", "option 3"
- "choice 1", "choice 2", "choice 3"
- "number 1", "number 2", "number 3"
- "1", "2", "3" (just numbers)
- "first", "second", "third"
- "one", "two", "three"

### Alternative Requests:

- "different times"
- "other options"
- "different options"
- "none of these"
- "cancel"

## Testing the System

### 1. **Start Both Servers**

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python main.py

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Test Conflict Resolution**

1. Connect to the voice assistant
2. Say: "Schedule meeting tomorrow at 2 PM" (or any conflicting time)
3. Wait for conflict panel to appear
4. Say: "Option 1", "Option 2", or "Option 3"
5. Verify the meeting gets scheduled with the selected option

### 3. **Expected Behavior**

- âœ… Configuration sent automatically on connection
- âœ… Only one audio response plays at a time
- âœ… Conflict panel shows options without interactive buttons
- âœ… Voice commands properly recognized and processed
- âœ… Original meeting details preserved during conflict resolution
- âœ… Clear visual feedback showing system is waiting for voice input

## Key Files Modified

### Backend:

- `main.py`: Added config message handling, fixed conflict resolution response
- `core/conversation_flow.py`: Added original meeting data preservation

### Frontend:

- `app/page.tsx`:
  - Removed UI interaction from conflict panel
  - Added audio playback prevention
  - Added config_received message handling
  - Added voice-only conflict resolution UI

## Voice Commands Summary

| Command           | Action                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| "Option 1"        | Select first alternative time  |
| "Option 2"        | Select second alternative time |
| "Option 3"        | Select third alternative time  |
| "Different times" | Request new options            |
| "Cancel"          | Cancel scheduling              |

The system now provides a seamless voice-only conflict resolution experience with proper error handling and state management.
